   ** HISTORY:
   **    - Originally written by Adam Twiss <adam@zeus.co.uk>, March 1996
   **      with input from Mike Belshe <mbelshe@netscape.com> and
   **      Michael Campanella <campanella@stevms.enet.dec.com>
   **    - Enhanced by Dean Gaudet <dgaudet@apache.org>, November 1997
   **    - Cleaned up by Ralf S. Engelschall <rse@apache.org>, March 1998
   **    - POST and verbosity by Kurt Sussman <kls@merlot.com>, August 1998
   **    - HTML table output added by David N. Welton <davidw@prosa.it>, January 1999
   **    - Added Cookie, Arbitrary header and auth support. <dirkx@webweaving.org>, April 1999
   ** Version 1.3d
   **    - Increased version number - as some of the socket/error handling has
   **      fundamentally changed - and will give fundamentally different results
   **      in situations where a server is dropping requests. Therefore you can
   **      no longer compare results of AB as easily. Hence the inc of the version.
   **      They should be closer to the truth though. Sander & <dirkx@covalent.net>, End 2000.
   **    - Fixed proxy functionality, added median/mean statistics, added gnuplot
   **      output option, added _experimental/rudimentary_ SSL support. Added
   **      confidence guestimators and warnings. Sander & <dirkx@covalent.net>, End 2000
   **    - Fixed serious int overflow issues which would cause realistic (longer
   **      than a few minutes) run's to have wrong (but believable) results. Added
   **      trapping of connection errors which influenced measurements.
   **      Contributed by Sander Temme, Early 2001
   ** Version 1.3e
   **    - Changed timeout behavour during write to work whilst the sockets
   **      are filling up and apr_write() does writes a few - but not all.
   **      This will potentially change results. <dirkx@webweaving.org>, April 2001
   ** Version 2.0.36-dev
   **    Improvements to concurrent processing:
   **      - Enabled non-blocking connect()s.
   **      - Prevent blocking calls to apr_socket_recv() (thereby allowing AB to
   **        manage its entire set of socket descriptors).
   **      - Any error returned from apr_socket_recv() that is not EAGAIN or EOF
   **        is now treated as fatal.
   **      Contributed by Aaron Bannert, April 24, 2002
   **
   ** Version 2.0.36-2
   **     Internalized the version string - this string is part
   **     of the Agent: header and the result output.
   **
   ** Version 2.0.37-dev
   **     Adopted SSL code by Madhu Mathihalli <madhusudan_mathihalli@hp.com>
   **     [PATCH] ab with SSL support  Posted Wed, 15 Aug 2001 20:55:06 GMT
   **     Introduces four 'if (int == value)' tests per non-ssl request.
   **
   ** Version 2.0.40-dev
   **     Switched to the new abstract pollset API, allowing ab to
   **     take advantage of future apr_pollset_t scalability improvements.
   **     Contributed by Brian Pane, August 31, 2002
   **
   ** Version 2.3
   **     SIGINT now triggers output_results().
