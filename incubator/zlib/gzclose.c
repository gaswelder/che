     Flush all pending output for file, if necessary, close file and
   deallocate the (de)compression state.  Note that once file is closed, you
   cannot call gzerror with file, since its structures have been deallocated.
   gzclose must not be called more than once on the same file, just as free
   must not be called more than once on the same allocation.

     gzclose will return Z_STREAM_ERROR if file is not valid, Z_ERRNO on a
   file operation error, Z_MEM_ERROR if out of memory, Z_BUF_ERROR if the
   last read ended in the middle of a gzip stream, or Z_OK on success.
